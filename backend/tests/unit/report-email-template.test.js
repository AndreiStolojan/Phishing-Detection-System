/*
 * Regression tests for the report email's safe-rate / threat breakdown.
 *
 * The bug: the monthly digest email computed its "% safe" and threat breakdown
 * from the RAW scan verdicts (counts.safe / counts.suspicious / ...) instead of
 * the EFFECTIVE verdicts that apply the user's manual "mark safe" / "mark
 * phishing" overrides. The report service already returns both — the dashboard
 * uses the effective ones, the email used the raw ones. So after a user marked
 * suspicious / likely-phishing emails as safe, the dashboard % moved but the
 * emailed % did not: they disagreed for the same period.
 *
 * These tests render the template directly (pure function, no DB) and assert the
 * email reflects the effective (post-review) numbers.
